    <h2>Hello, I am Sunwoo Jeong!</h2>
    <p>I am an 2nd year undergraduate student <br /> in <b>Departement of Intelligent Mechatronics Engineering</b> at <i>Sejong University</i></p>
    <p>I am interested in smart devices such as drone and self-driving car so I came to this department.</p>
    <p>
        I like <b>Coding and Programming</b>, and I've always had questions about the structure of <b>Internet Website</b> we use often.<br />
        so I got to take this lecture about Web Programming.
    </p>
    <p>I think Web Programming is very interesting because it has different characteristics from C and Java.</p>
    <p>I want to learn more about Web Programming while listening to this lecture.</p>
